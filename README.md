# TODO

## Write to csv
 - on start/stop add timestamp to file (should every write be a timestamp?)
 - get value of rpm, engine load and speed every second
 - the rest can be averaged over 5-10s

## Make flatlist of logs (done)
 - when clicked, display in a scrollview
 - have button to analyse them

## Push file to s3
 - when file written, upload to s3
